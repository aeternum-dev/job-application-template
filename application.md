Hello, I came across your job posting while browsing IndieHackers and I felt I needed to try applying. I have my own reasons for believing this is my right call professionally, but without going into those I'd like to go over some of your noted responsibilities and requirements for the job and how I feel like I'm a really good fit for them.

"Familiarity with Docker and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)", "Understanding of authentication/authorization (OAuth, JWT)", "Experience with asynchronous programming" - I have experience with Azure Cloud, writing pipelines, implementing authentication/authorization and asynchronous programming. So I'll be familiar with the workloads when I start picking them up.

"Experience with AI/ML services and APIs" - I also have experience with using and integrating AI services to achieve various results. So I'll be able to interact well with AI specialized teams.

"Familiarity with payment processing (Stripe)" - At my previous project, I implemented Paddle payment processing individually for our products. Meaning, managing Stripe implementation will be considerably easier for me.

So after all of these, I'd like to share some additional materials that might give you a better sense of my background. I've attached my CV for a detailed overview of my experience, along with my LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal website. These should provide a fuller picture of my technical capabilities and how I approach building products.
